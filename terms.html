        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Class Manager. By accessing or using our IMS, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the service.</p>

        <h2>1. Use License</h2>
        <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Class Manager PWA for your institute's internal management. You shall not attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, or "scrape" the source code of the application. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Class Manager at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>

        <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our service. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the service and for any activities or actions under your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <h2>3. Subscription & Payments</h2>
        <p>Class Manager offers both one-time sale licenses and subscription-based plans. You agree to provide a valid payment method. For subscription plans, your account will be billed on a recurring basis as per the cycle selected. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties. Failure to pay fees will result in the suspension of access to the Admin Dashboard and data entry features until the balance is cleared.</p>

        <h2>4. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
