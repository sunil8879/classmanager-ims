        <h1>ABOUT CLASS MANAGER</h1>
        <p>The Digital Revolution for Indian Institutes</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Our Journey & Vision</h2>
        <p>Class Manager was born out of a simple observation: coaching institutes in India are the backbone of our education system, yet most are still trapped in the "Paper Age." Founded in 2026, our mission was to create an Institute Management System (IMS) that is as powerful as an enterprise ERP but as simple as a WhatsApp chat. We realized that tutors were spending more time on attendance and fee chasing than on actual teaching. Class Manager changes that narrative by providing a seamless, cloud-based environment where every record is just a click away.</p>

                <h3>The Problem We Solve</h3>
                <p>Most small to medium-sized institutes struggle with fragmented data. Fees are recorded in one notebook, attendance in another, and student performance is rarely tracked scientifically. This leads to massive revenue leakage and decreased trust from parents. Class Manager centralizes these operations. By providing a single source of truth, we empower institute owners to identify pending payments instantly and monitor student growth over months and years, ensuring no child or rupee is left behind.</p>

                <h3>Our Core Values</h3>
                <p>We believe in <span class="highlight">Accessibility</span>, <span class="highlight">Integrity</span>, and <span class="highlight">Innovation</span>. Accessibility means our PWA works on a ₹5,000 smartphone just as well as a high-end laptop. Integrity means your data is secure and never shared. Innovation means we are constantly integrating AI and ML to predict fee defaults and student performance drops before they happen. We are built in India, specifically for the unique needs of the Indian coaching ecosystem.</p>
