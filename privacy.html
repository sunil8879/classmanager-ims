        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: February 2026</p>
        <p>At Class Manager, we understand that as an Institute Management System (IMS), we handle the most sensitive data of your business: student identities, parental contact details, and financial records. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to protecting this data with the highest standards of encryption and ethical practices.</p>

        <h3>1. Information Collection</h3>
        <p>We collect information that you voluntarily provide when you register an account, such as your institute name, authorized signatory details, and email address. Furthermore, as you use the system, you input third-party data regarding your students (names, roll numbers, mobile numbers) and staff. We act as a "Data Processor" for this information, while you, the institute owner, remain the "Data Controller." We also collect metadata like IP addresses and browser types to improve our PWA performance and security against unauthorized login attempts.</p>

        <h3>2. How We Use Data</h3>
        <p>The data collected is used strictly for administrative purposes. Student mobile numbers are used to facilitate attendance alerts and fee reminders via WhatsApp or SMS as triggered by your actions. Financial data is used to generate the Admin Dashboard analytics, allowing you to see revenue trends. We do not use your students' data for marketing, nor do we sell it to third-party educational content providers. Your data stays within your institute's siloed environment, protected by Row Level Security (RLS).</p>

        <h3>3. Data Security & Storage</h3>
        <p>We utilize Supabase and PostgreSQL for data storage, which includes enterprise-grade AES-256 encryption. Our systems are monitored 24/7 for suspicious activity. While no system is 100% secure, we implement strict "Need-to-Know" access protocols for our internal engineering team. We recommend that all institute owners use strong passwords and avoid sharing login credentials to maintain the integrity of their data portal.</p>

        <h3>4. Your Rights & Deletion</h3>
        <p>As a user, you have the right to export your data at any time in CSV or Excel format. If you choose to discontinue our services, you can request a complete permanent deletion of your institute's records from our servers. We will process such requests within 30 days, ensuring no residual data remains in our backups. By using Class Manager, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We reserve the right to update this policy as new technologies and legal requirements emerge.</p>
