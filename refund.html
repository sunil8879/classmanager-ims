            <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="body">
            <h2>Our Standard</h2>
            <p>At Class Manager, we strive for 100% satisfaction. Since we provide a digital product that can be accessed immediately upon payment, we have established a clear refund policy to protect both our customers and our development team. We encourage all users to use our 7-day free trial or demo version before making a purchase.</p>

            <h2>Eligibility</h2>
            <p>Refunds are generally processed only in cases of technical failure where the software fails to perform its core functions and our support team is unable to resolve the issue within 7 business days. Requests for refunds based on "change of mind" or "feature not present" (where the feature was not advertised) are not eligible for a refund after the license key has been activated or the first login has occurred.</p>

            <h2>One-Time Sales</h2>
            <p>For our one-time sale model (Lifetime License), a full refund is available within 48 hours of purchase, provided that the institute has not added more than 5 students to the database. This acts as a cooling-off period. Once the data migration or heavy usage has started, the product is considered "consumed," and no refund will be issued.</p>

            <h2>Subscription Plans</h2>
            <p>Subscriptions can be canceled at any time. However, we do not provide pro-rated refunds for the remaining days in a billing cycle. Upon cancellation, you will retain access to your dashboard until the end of the current paid period, after which your account will move to "Read Only" mode for 30 days before the data is archived.</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>To request a refund, please email our support desk with your Transaction ID and a detailed reason for the request. Our financial team will review the logs and usage patterns. Approved refunds are credited back to the original payment source (UPI, Bank, or Card) within 10-14 working days. Any bank charges or processing fees deducted by the payment gateway are non-refundable.</p>
